# Technical Design Guide

## 1. Rest Principals

REST stands for <b>REpresentation State Transfer (REST)</b>. Any information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal service (e.g. "todayâ€™s weather in Los Angeles"), a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on.
 It comes within the Uniform Resource Identifiers <b>(URI)</b>. URI is the simplest element of the Web architecture and the most important.

### Open API

- You <b>MUST define your REST contracts</b> using OpenAPI.
- Your <b>REST API SHOULD</b> be well documented using OpenAPI.
- <b>REST APIs MUST</b> be defined using the OpenAPI Specification.
- <b>API First Strategy</b>: APIs SHOULD be defined before coding starts
- REST APIs MAY be be defined using OpenAPI v3.0.0+ when the HATEOAS constraint is required.
- HATEOAS is an complex and expensive constraint to meet. It should not be the default choice for any API.
- Migration to OAS v3.0.0+ is planned for future phases of OpenAPI adoption.

#### Richardson Model Maturity

Level | Name | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
0 | Swamp of POX | Use HTTP as a transport protocol (e.g., single endpoint which is POST) 
1 | Resources | An endpoint per resource type 
2 | HTTP Verbs | Use HTTP properties to deal with scalability and faults (e.g., HTTP methods, HTTP response codes)

- APIs SHOULD strive to meet Level 2: HTTP Verbs in the Richardson Maturity Model.
- APIs SHOULD NOT strive to meet Level 3: Hypermedia controls in the Richardson Maturity Model.
