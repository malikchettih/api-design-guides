# Functional Design Guide

When designing an API, pause for a second and think. What are the forces driving changes in my product.

When API model is designed, it has to be:
- Be "Semantically Right", not just "Syntactically Right".
 - APIs must be reusable.
 - Materialized arround Bounded Context.
 - API should be minimal and complete
 - Manage the API Evolution
 - Encapsulate (again!)
- API Have CONTRACTS
